## Migration from Python pre-commit

1. **Install go-pre-commit** and remove Python version:

   ```bash
   pip uninstall pre-commit
   # Install go-pre-commit binary
   ```

2. **Existing configurations work as-is** - no changes needed to `.pre-commit-config.yaml`

3. **Re-install hooks** with the new binary:

   ```bash
   pre-commit uninstall
   pre-commit install
   ```

4. **Update CI/CD pipelines** to use the new binary

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

```bash
# Check installation health
pre-commit doctor

# Run with verbose output
pre-commit run --verbose

# Clean and retry
pre-commit clean
pre-commit run --all-files
```

**Environment issues:**

```bash
# Rebuild environments
pre-commit clean
pre-commit install --install-hooks

# Check specific language environment
pre-commit run --verbose <hook-id>
```

**Configuration issues:**

```bash
# Validate configuration
pre-commit validate-config

# Try a repository without installing
pre-commit try-repo https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks
```
