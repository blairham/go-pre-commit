## Performance

`go-pre-commit` delivers significant performance improvements over the original Python implementation:

### ⚡ Speed Comparison

| Operation | Go Implementation | Python Implementation | Performance Gain |
|-----------|-------------------|----------------------|------------------|
| **Real Language Environments** | ~656ms avg | ~2,821ms avg | **4.3x faster** |
| **System/Utility Hooks** | ~13ms avg | ~168ms avg | **13x faster** |

# First-time setup
$ time go-precommit install
real    0m0.089s  # Go implementation (eager setup by default)

$ time pre-commit install --install-hooks  
real    0m1.247s  # Python implementation
# Result: 14x faster setup
```

```bash
# Daily commits
$ time git commit -m "feat: new feature"
real    0m0.156s  # Go implementation

$ time git commit -m "feat: new feature"
real    0m0.724s  # Python implementation  
# Result: 4.6x faster commits
```

### 📊 Benefits for Teams

- **Faster CI/CD builds**: Save 1+ second per build
- **Improved developer experience**: Near-instant feedback

## Migration from Python pre-commit

1. **Install go-pre-commit** and remove Python version:

   ```bash
   pip uninstall pre-commit
   # Install go-pre-commit binary
   ```

2. **Existing configurations work as-is** - no changes needed to `.pre-commit-config.yaml`

3. **Re-install hooks** with the new binary:

   ```bash
   pre-commit uninstall
   pre-commit install
   ```

4. **Update CI/CD pipelines** to use the new binary

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Hook execution fails:**

```bash
# Check installation health
pre-commit doctor

# Run with verbose output
pre-commit run --verbose

# Clean and retry
pre-commit clean
pre-commit run --all-files
```

**Environment issues:**

```bash
# Rebuild environments
pre-commit clean
pre-commit install  # Environments are rebuilt automatically

# Check specific language environment
pre-commit run --verbose <hook-id>
```

**Configuration issues:**

```bash
# Validate configuration
pre-commit validate-config

# Try a repository without installing
pre-commit try-repo https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks
```

### Debug Mode

```bash
# Enable debug logging
export PRE_COMMIT_DEBUG=1
pre-commit run --verbose
```

## Development

This project uses [Mage](https://magefile.org/) for build automation and task management.

### Building

```bash
# Build development binary
mage dev

# Build release version
mage build:release

# Build for all platforms
mage build:all
```

### Testing

```bash
# Run unit tests
mage test:unit

# Run tests with coverage
mage test:coverage

# Generate HTML coverage report
mage test:coverageHTML
```

### Language Integration Testing

The project includes a comprehensive language integration testing framework that systematically verifies compatibility with the Python pre-commit implementation across all 21 supported languages:

```bash
# Run all language integration tests (comprehensive)
mage test:languages

# Test specific language categories
mage test:languagesCore          # Python, Node, Go, Rust, Ruby
mage test:languagesSystem        # system, script, fail, pygrep
mage test:languagesContainer     # docker, docker_image

# Test all languages grouped by category
mage test:languagesByCategory

# Test a specific language
mage test:languagesSingle python
mage test:languagesSingleGo rust  # Using Go test framework

# List all configured languages
mage test:languagesList
```

**Language Test Categories:**

- **Core Programming Languages**: Python, Node.js, Go, Rust, Ruby - Full environment testing
- **Mobile & Modern Languages**: Dart, Swift - Mobile development frameworks
- **Scripting Languages**: Lua, Perl, R - Scripting and data analysis
- **Functional & Academic**: Haskell, Julia - Academic and research languages
- **Enterprise & JVM**: .NET, Coursier - Enterprise development environments
- **Container & Environment**: Docker, Conda - Containerized and virtual environments
- **System & Utility**: system, script, fail, pygrep - System-level utilities

**Each language test verifies:**
- ✅ Installation performance vs Python pre-commit
- ✅ Caching behavior and efficiency
- ✅ Functional equivalence and output matching
- ✅ Environment isolation (where applicable)
- ✅ Version management and compatibility

**Test Reports:**
- **Live Results**: [test-output/test_summary.md](test-output/test_summary.md) - Latest integration test results
- **Individual Results**: [test-output/](test-output/) - Per-language detailed test results  
- **Performance Data**: Measurements of `install` time across different test configurations (Go now includes environment setup by default)
- **Test Date**: August 7, 2025 - All 21 languages passing with functional equivalence verified

**Test Methodology Note**: Performance measurements reflect the time to execute `pre-commit install` for each language. Go pre-commit now performs eager environment setup by default (no `--install-hooks` flag needed). Languages using remote repositories (Python, Node.js, .NET, etc.) measure full environment setup time, while languages using local test configurations measure configuration parsing and basic hook setup time. This explains the variation in performance improvements across different language types.
